# Conservation Status

‘**To date, many species groups including mammals, amphibians, birds, reef building corals and conifers have been comprehensively assessed. As well as assessing newly recognized species, the IUCN Red List also re-assesses the status of some existing species, sometimes with positive stories to tell. For example, good news such as the downlisting (i.e. improvement) of a number of species on the IUCN Red List categories scale, due to conservation efforts. The bad news, however, is that biodiversity is declining. Currently there are more than 105,700 species on The IUCN Red List, with more than 28,000 species threatened with extinction, including 40% of amphibians, 34% of conifers, 33% of reef building corals, 25% of mammals and 14% of birds.’ –** International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, established in 1964, is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s biodiversity. It is a powerful tool to inform and catalyse action for biodiversity conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural resources we need to survive. , such as information on population size, habitat and ecology, use and/or trade, threats, and conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation decisions. The IUCN Red List is used by a variety of institutions, such as government agencies, wildlife departments, educational organisations, and the business community. 

“The Red List process has become a massive enterprise involving the IUCN Biodiversity Assessment and Knowledge Team staff, partner organisations and experts in the IUCN Species Survival Commission and partner networks who compile the species information ***\*to make The IUCN Red List the indispensable product it is today\****.” – IUCN

# Human Interaction - ecological issues affecting wildlife

Source: IFAW

\1. Deforestation: the clearing or thinning of forests to make land suitable for uses, such as agriculture, livestock, or urbanization. A leading ecological issues threatening biodiversity, deforestation causes the shrinkage and elimination of many wildlife habitats. A threatened species is Australia’s koala population. Since their diet consists exclusively of eucalyptus leaves, they are especially vulnerable to deforestation. When trees are cut down, koalas lose their main source of food, leading to the large decrease of the koala populations and the species is now classed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. 

2, Habitat fragmentation: the breaking up of wildlife habitat into smaller pieces. It occurs when areas of a larger habitat are destroyed by natural causes or human activity, which prevents wildlife from moving safely between areas of land, disrupting seasonal feeding patterns and migration. Due to the smaller spaces and separatation from larger populations, species are exposed to stronger competition and face inbreeding, which may deplete their populations and impact biodiversity. Many species, such as the african savannah elephants and black rhinos, are currently impacted by ecological issues associated with habitat fragmentation. 

3, Poaching: the illegal hunting or live capture of any wild animal that you do not own or that is protected by law. Most of the time, poaching has become a sophisticated and large-scale operation driven by financial gain. The profit of selling exotic animals and their parts continues to drive poaching to this day. Some animals that face large-scale poaching include antelopes, elephants, and rhinos. 

Poaching is particularly complex because people may rely on poaching as a source of income, food, and traditional medicine in certain areas. A proposed solution is to proactively support alternative livelihoods for poachers, enabling them to find more wildlife-friendly income streams. There can also be more support to rangers, who work on the front lines to prevent wildlife crime. 

 

4, Bycatch: marine life that are accidentally caught during commercial fishing. Fish, turtles, dolphins, sharks… almost all marine animals are affected. As one of the most damaging ecological issues affecting ocean life, bycatch leads to severely injured or dead caught animals in the process of dragging wildlife to the surface in nets or trying to escape fishing gear, which they are trapped in. Some die from exhaustion while marine animals that need to surface for air often drown. 

\5. Overfishing: when too many fish within a particular population are caught while there are too few breeding adults to replenish the population. Although the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization monitors over 500 global fish stocks, it is still estimated that over a third of fish have been overfished, which is caused by higher levels of consumption and illegal fishing. 

Overfishing impacts biodiversity because the declining fish populations breaks down the food web, destroys habitats, and reduces populations of the marine life that maintain balance in these delicate ecosystems. Sharks are often overfished and killed for their fins, pushing some species of sharks towards extinction.  

\6. Pollution: when harmful materials, called pollutants, are released into the environment. Some pollutants like volcanic ash are natural, but humans are responsible for most of the pollution damaging the land, water, and air. Car fumes and smoke pollute the air, plastics and other discarded trash pollute the water, and sewage, industrial wastes, and pesticides pollute the land and waterways. Noise pollution is also a major type of pollution impacting marine animals like whales. 

All wildlife is endangered from the damaging ecological issues of air and water pollution. Air pollution alters the behavioral patterns of migratory animals, while plastics and chemical pollutants in bodies of water cause widespread issues among wildlife animals. 

\7. Droughts: prolonged periods of dry weather with a lack of precipitation, which eventually leads to water shortages. The ecological issue impacts habitats, agriculture, energy, and the environment. As temperatures rise due to global warming, drier regions of the planet become drier, increasing the risk and severity of droughts. 

Droughts can reduce water and food sources for land animals, disrupting the local food web and knocking ecosystems off balance. Wildfires are more common during droughts due to an increased flammability of grasses and trees. 

In the Horn of Africa region, an ongoing drought has severely impacted both the local people and the wildlife there. Since 2020, the region has experienced extremely dry rainy seasons, causing the Amboseli ecosystem alone to lose 6,093 wild animals as of February 2023. Domestic livestock have also been impacted, leading to a loss of livelihood for many farmers. 

\8. Oil and gas development: oil and gas release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pollute the air. Industries’ development can be responsible for reduced air quality due to emissions and dust, leaks and spills that damage ecosystems, and loss of vegetation and soil damage. In addition, oil spills permanently damage the ocean ecosystem and can harm tens of thousands of animals. In December 2023, an oil spill in India impacted as many as 200 pelicans. 

\9. Soil erosion: the top layer of the soil is worn away and shifted over time, changing the shape of the land. This can be a natural process (water and wind), but it can also be caused by human activity. Up to a third of the world’s soil displays a moderate-to-high degree of degradation. Soil erosion decreases soil fertility, which can reduce the health and biodiversity of vegetation. In addition, fewer plants means there are fewer species to absorb carbon dioxide and prevent the effects of global warming. It is estimated that healthy soil could absorb up to 5% of all the greenhouse gas emissions made by humans.  

\10. Soil degradation: the soil’s quality and its potential to support plants and animals diminishes. It includes chemical, physical, or biological changes that impact the soil ecosystem and the wildlife within it. Similar to soil erosion, soil degradation can be the result of natural processes, but it can also be accelerated by human activity through land clearing and intensive farming. Soil degradation affects wildlife through increased desertification and landslides, which can destroy habitats.

# What to do when encountering wild animals

## Cougar

● Quietly move away if the animal didn’t notice you, but if it already has, don’t run away. Try to make yourself appear big by raising your arms slowly or opening your jacket over your head. Face the cat and be aggressive—take two quick steps towards the cat or even charge the animal, the best way to send them running. Keep your eyes on the animal and don’t look away. If the cougar comes closer and none of those tactics have worked, throw objects like rocks or water bottles at it.

● Prevention: Make note of signs of the cougar including claw marks and scat on hiking trails. Also, select campsites far from rock overhangs and cliffs or thick brush, where cougars are more likely to appear.

 

## ● Bear 

● Stay where you are or move slowly to the side. Don’t run or scream. Don’t climb a tree since bears can climb, too. Instead, make yourself seem like difficult, big prey: Slowly wave your arms to make yourself appear large and try to remain calm. Talk out loud, both to calm yourself and to indicate to the bear that you’re a human.

● If attacked by a grizzly bear, play dead, lie with your stomach down (since it’s more easily ripped open) and leave your backpack on to better protect yourself. For a smaller black bear, don’t play dead. Instead, try to escape or fight back, concentrating your hits on the animal’s face and muzzle. 

● Better prevention: Make a lot of noise when in bear regions to keep animals from being startled, and avoid food sources like berry bushes. Keep your food and trash securely stowed and travel in groups. With bears and all animals, never place yourself between a mother and her young.

 

## ● Alligator 

● Avoid swimming with your dog and leash pets at places away from waters where alligators have been seen in the past. Keep them inside a fenced area or in the house for a few days after spotting an alligator, since the reptiles have a good sense of smell. 

● If attacked, the best defense is to poke at an alligator’s eyes and hit it on the head. With these blows, try to get the animal to gag and release you. When the animal opens its mouth to reposition, take advantage of the moment and flee. Run away in a straight line as fast as you can. Speed is essential, as alligators can run up to 35 miles per hour on land. 

● Better prevention: Avoid swimming at night when gators are most active and never try to feed the animals or swim in areas where warnings are posted.

 

## ● Bison 

● The animals can move at speeds of more than 30 miles per hour, hop over high fences, and swim. Stay in your vehicle if possible and don’t walk towards the animal to get a closer look. If it seems to have noticed you, back away slowly.

● Better prevention: Stay at least 25 yards away and preferably stay in your car.

● If attacked: Run.

 

## ● Coyote

● Make noise that would alert the animals to your presence, and if one still approaches, try to make yourself look big and wave your arms.

● If a coyote does bite a person, it would likely need to be removed from the wild and tested for rabies, so report any attacks to local authorities immediately.

● Better prevention: Don’t ever feed coyotes. Keep pets inside at night and secure all garbage and food. Motion-activated lights and electric fencing are used to protect livestock and are also key deterrents for coyote encounters. 

 

## ● Moose

● Do not feed a moose or see it up close, and make sure to keep any pets leashed around the animals. Try to make noise if you are in a known moose habitat. If you spot one, slowly back away in the direction you came, talk, and try to remain calm. More people are injured by moose than by bears in the state each year.

● If a moose charges you, hide behind a solid, large object like a tree or seek refuge inside a vehicle or building. If the animal does knock you down, curl into a ball, protect your head, and lie still until the moose retreats. Don’t move again until the moose has moved far away.

● Better prevention: Keep your distance.

 

## ● Snake

● Snakes usually won’t attack unless provoked, so try to give them space when you’re outside. If one is in a home, it’s best to vacate the room, shut the door, stuff a towel in the crack, and call a professional for help.

● If attacked: Assume the snake is venomous. Do not apply a tourniquet or attempt to suck out any venom. Try to sit or lie still and remain calm while you await help. Take a photograph of the snake from a safe distance if possible to help with treatment. If possible, clean the wound, cover it, and mark the edge of the affected area on the skin with the time.

● Better prevention: Never pick up a snake, even if you think it’s dead. Wear thick shoes and long pants if hiking in areas with snakes, and poke at the ground in front of you with a long stick when possible.

 

## ● Shark 

● Sharks are most active at night or during twilight, so take a dip during the day and stay in groups. Don’t let your pets in waters known to be frequented by sharks, and don’t enter the waters if you are bleeding or menstruating. Bright colored clothing may also attract unwanted shark attention.

● “If you see a shark around you, exit the water as calmly and quickly as you can. A lot of these species are ambush predators, so often there’s not much that you can do once an attack has taken place—it’s all about prevention,” says Luke Warwick, a marine biologist and director of the sharks and rays program at the Wildlife Conservation Society. If you are attacked, the most sensitive part of a shark to target is its nose, which is a bundle of nerves, and its eyes. 

● Better prevention: If you are going in waters that may have sharks, the best way to avoid them is to only swim during the daytime. If you see one of the animals, it is key to remain calm, as sharks are attracted to movements that resemble those of thrashing fish. Most attacks of humans are cases of mistaken identity or opportunistic attacks from old or sickened sharks.

 

## ● Lions and Cheetahs

● If you come upon a lion while it’s resting, back away. Usually, resting lions will stay resting as long as you don’t illicit their interest. It’s unlikely you’d come upon a cheetah while on foot since the animals typically avoid humans. Curious cheetahs or lions may approach a safari vehicle to smell, chew on parts of it, or even climb onto it. Always keep all of your limbs in the car, start the vehicle, and carefully move away from any animal that looks like it may want to interact with or climb onto the vehicle before it does.

● A curious cheetah may reach out to touch a person or their camera, but it’s important not to react and to remain still until the animal loses interest. If you encounter a lion, stay calm, avoid eye contact, and don’t try to run or touch the animal. If you are in a position to carefully and slowly move away from the lion to safety without turning your back on it, then it might be worth doing so. Otherwise, stay put, minimize all movement, and wait.

● Cheetah attacks are extremely rare. If a lion does decide to charge you, make yourself as big as possible, stand your ground or even move with purpose towards the lion while yelling and making a lot of noise. Do not turn your back or run.

 

● Better prevention: Do not attempt to approach these animals and stay in your vehicle.
